    recoveryDetailsBody:
      "We are not sure whether your last message was actually received by the AI channel. Network blips, a busy channel, or a dropped connection can all leave the send in this unclear state.",
    recoveryDetailsBodyWhy:
      "A shared chat must keep a strict turn order. If we let you send the next message while the last one is still unresolved, the timeline can get out of sync. So the input is locked until this turn is settled.",
    recoveryDetailsAutoTitle: "Auto-fix",
    recoveryDetailsAuto:
      "Best for most cases. One click runs a safe sequence: check status, stop any in-flight request if needed, then change the connection if it is still stuck. It tries to recover or clean up this turn, but it will not skip the turn for you.",

    recoveryDetailsSkip:
      "Use this when you do not want to wait and do not need that unconfirmed message. After you confirm, this turn is marked cancelled and the session unlocks. History is kept. This settles the turn only — it does not replace the underlying connection.",
    recoveryDetailsRebuildTitle: "Change connection",
    recoveryDetailsRebuild:
      "Advanced. Best-effort stop, then archive the old binding and open a new one. The shared chat stays the same; only the underlying pipe changes. Use when the pipe is broken — not as a substitute for skipping the turn.",

    recoveryDetailsDiffSkip:
      "Drop the unconfirmed message → mark cancelled → unlock. History stays; no pipe change. Prefer this when auto-fix fails.",

    recoveryDetailsDiffRebuild:
      "Replace the underlying pipe and try again. For broken connections only. May still fail if ownership is mismatched — not the same as abandon.",
    recoveryDetailsDiffTip:
      "Everyday path: auto-fix → if that fails, skip turn. Change connection is for advanced recovery, not a twin of skip.",
    recoveryDetailsAdvancedTitle: "Other advanced options",
    recoveryDetailsAdvanced:
      "Expand also shows “Check again” (read-only status) and “Stop request” (only when something is in flight). Usually unnecessary; after auto-fix fails, prefer skip turn.",

    recoveryCollapseAdvanced: "Hide advanced options",
    recoveryAdvancedHint:
      "Usually unnecessary. Auto-fix already runs these steps in order.",
